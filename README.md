The source code is a modified part of a two-part tutorial for beginners who want to start to build applications using React and add an authentication layer to it. It was written by Vladmir Ponomarev with a corresponding blog post explaning how and why everything works (blog post is still valid, code looks slightly different with more validation checks and ES6).
